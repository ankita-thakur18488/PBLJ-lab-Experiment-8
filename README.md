# PBLJ-lab-Experiment-8 (Servlets and JSP)

## Overview

This experiment covers fundamental and advanced concepts of Servlets and JSP (Java Server Pages), essential for building dynamic web applications. Servlets are Java programs that run on a web server, handling client requests and generating dynamic responses. JSP enables embedding Java code in HTML pages for easier server-side scripting.

### Topics Covered

- Servlet Basics: Servlet Lifecycle, Generic Servlet, HttpServlet, Linking Servlet to HTML
- HTTP Servlet Request and Response: Handling GET and POST requests
- Database Integration: Connecting Servlets with JDBC for data retrieval and manipulation
- Servlet Configuration: Configuring servlets using web.xml, ServletConfig, and ServletContext
- JSP Essentials: JSP directives, Scriptlets, Expressions, and Declaration tags
- JSP Page Handling: Including files, using JSP actions, and handling user inputs dynamically
  
## 📌 Experiment 7:Develop web applications using Servlets and JSP for user input handling, database integration.
