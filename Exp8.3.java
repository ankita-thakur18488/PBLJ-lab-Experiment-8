Steps to Develop a JSP-Based Student Portal with Attendance Submission
  
1. Set Up the Database (MySQL)
Create a database named StudentDB.
Create a table attendance with columns: id, student_name, date, status.
Insert sample records for testing.

2. Configure Your Java Project
Add MySQL JDBC Driver (via Maven or manually).
Set up Apache Tomcat in your IDE (Eclipse/VScode).

3. Create a Database Connection Class (DBConnection.java)
This utility class connects to MySQL.

4. Create the JSP Form (attendance.jsp)
A form where users enter student name, date, and attendance status (Present/Absent).

5. Develop the Servlet (AttendanceServlet.java)
Handles form submission and saves attendance to the database.
Uses JDBC to insert data into MySQL.

6. Configure web.xml (If Needed)
Map AttendanceServlet to handle form submissions.

7. Deploy & Test
Run on Tomcat.
Access via http://localhost:8080/YourAppName/attendance.jsp.
Submit attendance, check database for saved records.

Enhancements (Optional)
- Display submitted attendance records in attendance.jsp.
- Add CSS/Bootstrap for better UI.
- Implement session handling for authentication.
